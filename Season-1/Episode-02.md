# Episode 2: How JavaScript Code is Executed?

## Execution Context and Phases

- JavaScript code is executed inside **execution contexts**.
- Execution contexts have **two phases**:
  1. Memory Creation Phase
  2. Code Execution Phase

---

## Memory Creation Phase

- In the memory creation phase, **memory is allocated** to variables and functions.
- Variables are assigned the value **undefined**.
- Functions are stored in memory **as they are**.

---

## Code Execution Phase

- In the code execution phase, code executes **line by line**.
- Variables created in the Memory Creation Phase start **assigning values** as code executes.
- Functions are invoked by creating a **new execution context**.
- Every execution context has its **own memory component and code component**.
- Code inside the function is executed.
- `return` statements return control to the **invoking execution context**.
- Return values are stored in memory **if stored in a variable**.
- After a function finishes execution, its **execution context is deleted**.

---

## Execution Context Working

- JavaScript first creates the **Global Execution Context (GEC)**.
- When a function is called, a **new Function Execution Context (FEC)** is created.
- Each execution context contains:
  - Memory Component
  - Code Component
- After execution, control goes back to the previous execution context.

---

## Call Stack

- The **call stack** manages all execution contexts.
- The call stack is also known as:
  - Execution Context Stack
  - Program Stack
  - Control Stack
  - Runtime Stack
  - Machine Stack
- It maintains the **order of execution** of execution contexts.
- Each new execution context is **pushed** onto the stack.
- The **topmost execution context** is the one currently being executed.
- The **bottom execution context** is always the **Global Execution Context (GEC)**.
- Other execution contexts are **Function Execution Contexts (FEC)**.
- When a function finishes execution, its execution context is **popped** from the stack.
- Eventually, the **Global Execution Context is also popped**, and program execution is completed.
